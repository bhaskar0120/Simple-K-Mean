### A simple algorithm to play around with the wine data set

The data set can be found at [Wine dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine)

#### Solution

We solve this by using K-Means algorithm as we know there are a total of
3 groups in the dataset.

#### Preparation

Using a simple prepare script I have separated the labels from the actual
data
