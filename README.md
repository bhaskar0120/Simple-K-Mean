### A simple algorithm to play around with the wine data set

The data set can be found at [Wine dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine)

Using the simple prepare.py script I have seperated the data into training 
data and testing data.

#### The sample distribution is as follows:
|   Data type   | No of samples |
|:-------------:|---------------|
| Training data | 125           | 
| Testing data  | 53            |
